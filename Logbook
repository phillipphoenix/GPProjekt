//THIS IS THE LOGBOOK
Write your log here under the date of writing in the following format

//DATE (DD-MM-YYYY) - (Maybe a milestone text after the dash)
Change1
Change2
We thought thought nb 1
We thought thought nb 2
Etc.

ALWAYS add new dates ABOVE older ones!
In that way, we don't need to scroll down to write each time.
Also this keeps the newest additions in the top of the log.
