//THIS IS THE LOGBOOK
Write your log here under the date of writing in the following format

//DATE (DD-MM-YYYY) - (Maybe a milestone text after the dash)
Change1
Change2
We thought thought nb 1
We thought thought nb 2
Etc.

ALWAYS add new dates ABOVE older ones!
In that way, we don't need to scroll down to write each time.
Also this keeps the newest additions in the top of the log.

//12-12-2011
Phillip added some a getLength method to the Reservation Class
Lauge and Phillip changed the implementation of CustomerDB and MechanicDB,
	which resulted in both classes being deleted and the implementation being in UserDB

	Address in user information
	Customer in one or two classes

//10-12-2011

Anders ought to test this implementation, by using it with the GUI

//09-12-2011 - First database connection!
Lauge and Phillip worked with database connection and at last it worked
Further work will be on the DB classes with real implementation of methods with DB connection
Anders worked with the GUI and finished the basics of the table giving the overview over the reservations for cars
